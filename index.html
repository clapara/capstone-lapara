        <p>&quot;It&rsquo;s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;There is no legitimate reason for secret collection of private data for marketing purposes.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Big Tech management is monstrously greedy, callous, dangerous, and disingenuous. Anything that can be done to rein in these individuals is overdue.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Without added privacy, we have proven that we're willing to undercut our democracy.&quot;</p>  
    </div>

    <p>In August, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was &quot;exploring&quot; creating rules around the unfettered collection of online data by companies, and that it sought public input on the topic. Since then, the agency has received 11,000 comments on its proposed rulemaking.</p>

    <p>Some comments include attachments to research-rich studies by lobbying groups and advocacy organizations. Others written by small business owners extoll the value of Google's business tools and ask the FTC to not change a thing. Plenty are the result of mass messaging campaigns. And still others, some shown here, are presumably written by ordinary people &mdash; internet users across the country.</p>
    
    <div class="quotes">
        <p>&quot;Enough of being spied on all the time, eavesdropped in all our private conversations even. What is a government for if it can&rsquo;t protect its citizens?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Social media companies must be limited on tracking and following users. Just because I went online to find a restaurant's phone number does not mean I want to see twenty ads about restaurants in my area. STOP BURYING ME IN RUBBISH!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Regulations needed!! Please!!&quot;</p>
    </div>

    <p>Three-fourths of Americans report being concerned about their online data being collected. Internet users are employing ad blockers more than ever before. Legislators and regulators are, however clumsily, catching on to the fear and trying to address it. Now, so are the data collectors themselves: Big Tech.</p>

    <p>Companies like Meta, Apple and Google have each announced steps, and in some cases taken them, towards something that resembles a more private online user experience. But data collection coupled with digital ad targeting brought the big tech companies to their positions of dominance. In the face of consumer and government reaction, they are determined not to let it be their undoing.</p>

    <p>[NEED BETTER QUOTE] &quot;The rub for [tech companies] is, I think in order to actually do that [improve privacy], their business model doesn't work. They need both things to be true,&quot; said Matt Kent, a competition policy advocate at Public Citizen, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group. &quot;They can't square that circle.&quot;</p>

    <p>To solve the puzzle, tech companies have outwardly embraced privacy protections in an effort to placate regulators and consumers, while internally continuing to harvest data.</p>

    <h2>Attacks on tech</h2>

    <p>First, a rundown of what exactly led these companies to go through the effort of promising privacy to their users.</p>

    <p>Big Tech &mdash; a catchall describing the companies that comprise the largest share of the tech industry, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon &mdash; made their fortunes by collecting and selling user data to advertisers.</p>

    <p>Targeted advertising built the internet of today, and data is its currency. Now, Big Tech is facing scrutiny on multiple fronts, all stemming from this data collection.</p>

    <p>The companies have been accused of holding monopoly power in the tech, advertising and publishing industries, powered in part by data. &quot;They've got these platforms, these combinations [of] software, hardware, people, data, that gives them a strong competitive advantage,&quot; said economist Jim Bessen.</p>

    <p>Bessen argues for making private software open source to smooth out the tech industry's playing field. And some companies have opened up their code, Bessen points out. &quot;Google makes some of its AI software open source,&quot; he said. &quot;But nobody has the same data that Google has.&quot;</p>

    <p>To date, Google has been the target of no less than two lawsuits by the Justice Department regarding its antitrust practices. Several proposed bills in Congress aim to break down various advantages that Big Tech companies enjoy, chief among them being the ability to collect and sell data with impunity. </p>

    <p>A non-exhaustive list of legal actions and proposed legislation against Big Tech:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Legislation: American Data and Privacy Act</li>
        <li>Legislation: Consumer Data Privacy and Security Act</li>
        <li>Legislation: American Innovation and Choice Online Act </li>
        <li>Lawsuit: Justice Department sued Google in 2020 for violating antitrust laws in internet searching</li>
        <li>Lawsuit: 17 states sued Google in 2022 for violating antitrust laws in the advertising industry</li>
        <li>Lawsuit: Another coalition of 30 states sued Google in 2022 for violating antitrust laws</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But these attempted regulations are theoretical, to go into effect only if political will allows it. To some, the proposals are far behind the times.</p>

    <p>&quot;Decades and decades have passed without legislation of any kind coming in. Think about what has happened to the internet since 1999,&quot; said Emily Peterson-Cassin, an attorney and digital rights advocate at Public Citizen. &quot;Congress is behind the ball, they are in the past. The internet is still a series of tubes to them.&quot;</p>

    <p>To antitrust advocates, an unregulated data landscape has paved the way for unfair market concentration, creating barriers for other companies to compete in the digital advertising industry.</p>

    <p>&quot;Foremost among these barriers is the need for detailed personal data about the consumer,&quot; wrote David Dinielli, a senior advisor at Omidyar Network in 2020 testimony for the House Antitrust Committee's investigation into Google's alleged antitrust practices. &quot;It would be virtually impossible for [a] new entrant to replicate this depth or breadth of personal data.&quot;</p>

    <p>From a privacy standpoint, the lack of structure has left internet users confused and concerned about how their data is being used, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center report. More than 80 percent of survey respondents believed that the potential risks of their data in tech companies' or the government's hands outweighed any benefit, while the same proportion believed there was nothing they could do to keep their data private.</p>

    <p>Tech companies are &quot;privy to the research that people feel resigned,&quot; said Peterson-Cassin. &quot;People feel, I think to some degree rightly, like they can't do anything about this data collection&#8230;All they want to do is get an Uber or order something on Amazon, and whatever else happens with that data, it's too hard to control. You can't even know how to get out of it if you wanted to.&quot;</p>

    <p>Beyond monopoly and privacy concerns, some groups fear unregulated data collection contributes to more nefarious outcomes.</p>

    <p>&quot;The overcollection and out-of-context secondary uses of personal data&#8230;are inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of online consumers,&quot; wrote the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a non-profit group, in comments to the FTC. &quot;These unfair commercial surveillance practices lead to invasive, discriminatory targeting that violates the privacy and autonomy of consumers while fueling division, misinformation, and harassment that undermine democratic institutions.&quot;</p>

    <h2>The things tech companies say</h2>

    <p>Under mounting investigations into their tracking practices and increasing calls for regulation, tech companies have announced changes promising more privacy for users. Taken together, the announcements look like a seismic shift towards a less invasive world. But looking closer, the trend is more like rearranging the furniture and calling it a new civilization.</p>

    <p>&quot;I think what you're seeing here play out is something you see a lot with industries trying to get out ahead of regulation,&quot; said Public Citizen's Kent.</p>

    <p>One by one, here are how tech companies are responding to the pushback against data tracking: </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Google</summary>
        <p>Nearly three years ago Google announced plans to remove the world's most notorious data tracking technology from the world's most popular web browser. The company said it would phase out the use of third party cookies, pieces of data taken and stored from websites, from Google Chrome, while replacing them with more privacy-protecting tracking capabilities.</p>

    <p>&quot;&#8203;People want assurances that their identity and information are safe as they browse the web. That&rsquo;s why Chrome introduced the Privacy Sandbox,&quot; wrote the company's User Trust and Privacy group manager Chetna Bindra in a January 2020 blog post.</p>

    <p>The response from the advertising industry, which depends heavily on the use of third party cookies, was sharp. An industry group issued a statement at the time, saying that the change would &quot;substantially disrupt much of the infrastructure of today&rsquo;s Internet&quot; and possibly &quot;choke off the economic oxygen from advertising that startups and emerging companies need to survive.&quot;</p>

    <p>So far, cookies are still in place on Chrome, and Google has pushed the phase out timeline back from the end of 2022 to late 2024.</p>

    <p>While the cookie deprecation decision has made headlines for having the potential to alter the structure of the internet and crumple the adtech industry, skeptics are quick to point out that Google doesn't need third party cookies to track its users.</p>

    <p>&quot;In reality, they would still collect and monetize consumer information in the same way,&quot; said Katie McInnis, public policy manager at DuckDuckGo, a privacy-first browser company. </p>
      </details> 

      <details>
        <summary>Apple</summary>
        <p>While Google's changes are theoretically in the future, Apple has already implemented some. Apple led the pack when it came to publicly curbing third-party data collection, prompting ire from fellow tech behemoths who realized later they had better get on board.</p>

        <p>With its iOS 14.5 update in April 2021, Apple let some 2 billion iPhone users choose whether or not to let their apps track them. </p>
        
        <img src="images/ask app.jpg" alt="screenshot showing Apple's 'ask app not to track' prompt">

        <p>The company calls it App Tracking Transparency, and it seems simple enough: app developers are required to ask users if they want the app to collect their data.</p>

    <p>But the reaction from rival tech giant Facebook &mdash; which took out a full-page ad in the New York Times claiming it was &quot;standing up&quot; to Apple on behalf of small businesses who use personalized advertising &mdash; suggests there is more to the one-time pop-up bubble than users would think.</p>

    <p>Apple's changes meant that if users blocked apps from tracking them, Facebook and Instagram could not mine their useful &mdash; and lucrative &mdash; data.</p>

    <p>Indeed, as a result of Apple's changes Meta's advertising revenue fell 4.5% in the third quarter of 2022 compared with the previous year, while that of its rivals increased, Bloomberg reported.</p>

    <p>&quot;Sometimes you get thinking that the big tech companies are all acting in concert on everything and they're not. They're trying to compete with each other,&quot; said Kent of the trend towards privacy. &quot;Big tech are stabbing each other in the back constantly, the capitalists that they are.&quot;</p>
    
    </details> 

      <details>
        <summary>Meta and Facebook</summary>
        <p>Facebook's parent company Meta found one way to keep up after being cut off by Apple: publicize privacy.</p>

        <p>In late 2021, Meta aired two commercials proclaiming the company's support for increased regulations.</p>

        <p>&quot;Federal legislation can give our platforms and other platforms guidelines so we can have a consistent approach,&quot; said one of the interviewees portraying a Facebook Privacy Team member named Rochelle.</p>

        <p>Meta has also been the target of intense scrutiny around political advertising. The Cambridge Analytica scandal in the wake of the 2016 presidential election, in which the British political consulting firm illegally accessed 87 million Facebook users' data and assisted Donald Trump's presidential campaign, spotlighted the power of data collection.</p>

        <p>In response to this and several other reports of disinformation and discrimination via advertising, in January 2022 Facebook stopped advertisers from being able to target users based on health information, race or ethnicity, organizations like religious affiliations and sexual orientation.</p>
      </details> 

      <h2>"Half-assed anonymization"</h2>

      <p>These privacy proclamations and proposed changes, while well-publicized, do not amount to much.</p>

    <p>&quot;The tech companies have basically decided what they can do while still remaining profitable,&quot; said Matt Kent. &quot;And a lot of times, that's basically window dressing &mdash; privacy that doesn't really protect your information, or it's sort of this half assed anonymization of data.&quot;</p>

    <p>Without third-party cookies, Google can still collect data in other ways. Apple has iPhone user data, even if the apps do not. And Meta continues to allow targeted ads based on specific user characteristics.</p>

    <p>&quot;This is not this is not about reducing the amount of data they collect,&quot; said Peterson-Cassin. &quot;This is about locking down the data they collect, to make sure it's not available to other entities.&quot;</p>

    <p>In other words, the companies' claims of moving towards privacy serve as a way for them to maintain dominance while regaining consumer trust.</p>

    <p>Given the futility of individual and corporate action in stanching the data flow, experts say the only option is regulation. Peterson-Cassin says the American Data and Privacy Protection Act, introduced by New Jersey Democratic Congressman Frank Pollone, is a substantive option.</p>

    <p>The bill proposes a prohibitive use framework, meaning that instead of companies having assumed permission to collect data anywhere, data collection would be prohibited as a baseline.</p>

    <p>Such an enormous change would impact big tech companies by shutting off the data faucet. But it is unclear what the internet would look like on the other side. Opponents of such regulation argue that the tech companies have made the internet more efficient, and legislators should not undo their progress.</p>

    <p>Even supporters of the legislation like Peterson-Cassin see the other side. &quot;[Tech companies] do want to make good products,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't think they want to be evil.&quot;</p>

    <p>With Congress changing hands early next year, lobbyists say that momentum that had built towards passing privacy or antitrust legislation is slowing.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, the tech industry is being taken down in a different way, as stock prices plummet and layoffs and cost-cutting plans are announced in rapid succession.</p>
