    <h1>Cookies, pop-ups and commercials: How tech companies' privacy promises are preserving their data dominance</h1>
    <p>by Cailley LaPara</p>
    
    <p>When the Federal Trade Commission asks the public to weigh in on new regulations, it might receive 23 responses, as in a recent case of rules for telemarketers. When the agency announced last summer that it might write up new privacy regulations for tech companies, 11,000 people weighed in. And they were angry.</p>

    <p>&quot;It&rsquo;s become nearly impossible to avoid being surveilled in daily life,&quot; wrote one commenter.</p>
    
    <p>Said another: &quot;Big Tech management is monstrously greedy, callous, dangerous, and disingenuous. Anything that can be done to rein in these individuals is overdue.&quot;</p>
    
    <p> The tech industry has heard the outcry and is promising to do something about it, in the form of changes that will herald in an era of greater privacy. But because privacy and profits are mutually exclusive for tech companies, the changes actually mostly just shift who controls the data.</p>
    
    <p>&quot;They can't square that circle,&quot; said Matt Kent, a competition policy advocate at Public Citizen, a lobbying group based in Washington, D.C.</p>
    
    <p>As a result, any fundamental changes are likely to have to come from Washington. Although the Biden Administration is now focused on the issue, whether the regulations can overcome a relentless lobbying effort by the tech industry remains to be seen.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;These companies are so big and powerful that they can throw a ton of money into politics to distort it to their own gain,&rdquo; Erik Peinert, research manager at the American Economic Liberties Project.</p>

<h2>The veneer of choice</h2>

    <p>To solve the puzzle of privacy versus profits, tech companies have outwardly embraced privacy protections in an effort to placate regulators and consumers, while internally continuing to harvest data.</p>

    <p>Take, for example, Apple&rsquo;s 2021 system update. With it, the most popular smartphone manufacturer gave some 2 billion iPhone users the choice to let their apps track them, or not.</p>

    <p>Apple calls it App Tracking Transparency, and it seems simple enough: app developers are required to ask users if they want the app to collect their data.</p>

    <p>One year after the &ldquo;Ask App Not to Track&rdquo; bubble first surfaced on people&rsquo;s screens, 75 percent of iPhone users, newly gifted with the power to control their data, were preventing app tracking.</p>

    <div class="container">

    <p>And it&rsquo;s not just Apple giving people buttons to click. Since a sweeping 2018 European Union data privacy law went into effect, cookie policy pop-ups are proliferating across the internet, allowing users with spare time to click through the cookie checklist and permit or forbid certain types of cookies from following them around.</p>

    <p>But the sense of power is exactly that. The data still exists, and it gets stored someplace. In Apple&rsquo;s case, while app developers may be barred from indulging in the information buffet, as the first party Apple is left alone to gorge.</p>

    <p>&quot;This is not this is not about reducing the amount of data they collect,&quot; said Emily Peterson-Cassin, an attorney and digital rights advocate at Public Citizen. &quot;This is about locking down the data they collect, to make sure it's not available to other entities.&quot;</p>

    <p>Hoarding data gives Apple a competitive edge. If users opt out of tracking, rival tech giants like Meta are suddenly cut off from a once freely available and lucrative data source via its platforms Facebook and Instagram.</p>

    <p>In reaction to App Tracking Transparency, Meta took out a full-page ad in the New York Times claiming it was &quot;standing up&quot; to Apple on behalf of small businesses who use personalized advertising. The tussle suggests there is power in the onetime pop-up, just not for users.</p>

    <p>Partially because of Apple&rsquo;s changes, Meta's advertising revenue fell 4.5% in the third quarter of 2022 compared with the previous year, while that of its rivals increased, Bloomberg reported.</p>

    <p>&quot;Sometimes you get thinking that the big tech companies are all acting in concert on everything and they're not. They're trying to compete with each other,&quot; said Kent of the trend towards privacy. &quot;Big tech are stabbing each other in the back constantly, the capitalists that they are.&quot;</p>

<h2>Crumbling competition</h2>

    <p>Privacy changes have the benefit of decimating competition to tech giants in general, with smaller players caught in the crossfire.</p>

    <p>Three years ago, Google proclaimed it would remove third party cookies from the world's most popular web browser Google Chrome, sparking fear over the fate of the advertising industry.</p>

    <p>The cookie, invented in the mid-1990s to make the online shopping cart function, is a small piece of data taken from websites and stored on a browser. Today, cookies gather a breadth of information like location, what users looked at and how much time they spent on the page. The expansion of the cookie has allowed digital advertisers to track users and present them with personalized ads across the internet and devices.</p>

    <p>Google framed the decision as a response to consumer concerns. &quot;People want assurances that their identity and information are safe as they browse the web,&quot; wrote the company's privacy group manager Chetna Bindra in a January 2020 blog post announcing the phase out. (So far, cookies are still in place on Chrome, and Google pushed the phase out timeline back from the end of 2022 to late 2024.)</p>

    <p>The response from the digital advertising industry, which depends heavily on the use of third party cookies, was apocalyptic. An industry group issued a reactionary statement, saying that the change would &quot;substantially disrupt much of the infrastructure of today&rsquo;s Internet&quot; and possibly &quot;choke off the economic oxygen from advertising that startups and emerging companies need to survive.&quot;</p>

    <p>The advertisers were fighting to retain access to a sliver of an industry that is already predominately occupied by Big Tech: by some expert estimates, Google controls 90 percent of the &ldquo;ad tech stack,&rdquo; or the numerous steps to get ads in front of eyeballs. And without data, competitors are impotent.</p>

    <h2>Public displays of privacy</h2>
        <p>The privacy changes companies make are often accompanied by public-facing announcements, oriented towards consumers to soften their fears of being tracked. As the flimsy buffers created by these changes offer little real protection, the tech companies are saying: don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re working to keep you safe. It&rsquo;s a narrative designed to improve the tech industry&rsquo;s reputation without interfering with its lifeblood.</p>

        <p>Nowhere is this push more evident than in Meta&rsquo;s 2021 commercial campaign. After being stymied by Apple&rsquo;s tracking transparency, Facebook&rsquo;s parent company identified the only way to keep up: publicize privacy. It aired two commercials proclaiming the company's support for increased regulations around data collection.</p>
    
        <p>&quot;Federal legislation can give our platforms and other platforms guidelines so we can have a consistent approach,&quot; said an interviewee portraying a Facebook Privacy Team member named Rochelle.</p>
    
        <p>To lobbyists, the companies&rsquo; true aim with the commercials and privacy changes is clear. &quot;What you're seeing here play out is something you see a lot, with industries trying to get out ahead of regulation,&quot; said Kent. &quot;The tech companies have basically decided what they can do while still remaining profitable. And a lot of times, that's basically window dressing.&rdquo;</p>
    
        <p>But regulation, if passed, would fundamentally alter the structure of the tech industry, probably shrinking the tech giants as it does.</p>

    <h2>The role of government</h2>

        <p>With Big Tech enemy and antitrust wunderkind Lina Khan at the helm, the Federal Trade Commission wields the greatest force against Big Tech right now.</p>

        <p>After decades of taking a hands-off approach to the tech industry presumably to foster innovation, the regulatory agency under Khan is tackling tech&rsquo;s dominance. It has dealt blows by challenging mergers like Microsoft's takeover of video game company Activision Blizzard.</p>
    
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re now in a system where people are the product, data is the product, and the law hasn&rsquo;t caught up with that,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s changing. There&rsquo;s movement in civil society and different areas of the government.&rdquo;</p>
    
        <p>Last summer the FTC launched its offensive on data collection by asking the public to weigh in on whether regulations are needed &quot;to protect people&rsquo;s privacy and information in the commercial surveillance economy.&quot; The comment window closed in November, and the agency has yet to announce whether it will take the next step. This is where Peterson-Cassin says &quot;the game&quot; is happening, although the process could take years.</p>
    
        <p>If the FTC has the most momentum in government, it's not because the agency is particularly fast-moving, but because other branches are even slower.</p>
    
        <p>&quot;Decades and decades have passed without legislation of any kind coming in. Think about what has happened to the internet since 1999,&quot; said Peterson-Cassin. &quot;Congress is behind the ball, they are in the past. The internet is still a series of tubes to them.&quot;</p>
    
        <p>Despite the lack of tech savvy in Congress, there is one bill with teeth making its way through the House, called the American Data and Privacy Protection Act. It would fundamentally change the internet from one where data collection is assumed to one where data collection is prohibited unless users allow it.</p>
    
        <p>Such an enormous shift would impact big tech companies by shutting off the data faucet, but no one knows what the internet would look like on the other side. Opponents argue that tech companies &mdash; spying and all &mdash; have made the internet more efficient, and legislators should not undo their progress.</p>
    
        <p>Despite the antitrust fervor, many small business owners say they do not want to see data collection curbed because it benefits them. Among the 11,000 comments to the FTC, several are on behalf of small businesses urging the agency not to impose rules on tech companies.</p>
    
        <p>&quot;The Federal Trade Commission must understand how data-powered personalized advertising drives so much of our success and why any changes to the current rules could negatively impact our small business,&quot; reads a comment attributed to the president of a vacation rental business in the Outer Banks, N.C. &quot;Data-powered ads are vital to our ability to attract customers, and regulating these activities could really hurt us.&quot;</p>
    
        <p>Derek Peebles, executive director of the American Independent Business Association, sees it differently. &quot;A lot of retailers don't see an alternative&quot; to using platforms like Amazon, Google and Facebook, said Peebles. &quot;And consumers are often unaware of the impacts that big tech has on smaller businesses, because consumers are blinded by the convenience&quot; of next-day shipping or the appearance of an ad for the exact shoe a shopper wants.</p>
    
        <p>People &mdash; business owners and consumers alike &mdash; are simultaneously dependent on data collection and angry about it. The dilemma leaves people feeling helpless: more than 80 percent of Americans feel there is nothing they can do to keep their data private. And yet, data powers the awesomeness of the internet.</p>
    
        <p>Even supporters of regulation like Peterson-Cassin see the other side. &quot;[Tech companies] do want to make good products,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't think they want to be evil.&quot;</p>
